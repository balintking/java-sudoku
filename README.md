## About the Game

### Description
Sudoku, also known as Su Doku, popular form of number game. In its simplest and most common configuration, sudoku consists of a 9 × 9 grid with numbers appearing in some of the squares. The object of the puzzle is to fill the remaining squares, using all the numbers 1–9 exactly once in each row, column, and the nine 3 × 3 subgrids. Sudoku is based entirely on logic, without any arithmetic involved, and the level of difficulty is determined by the quantity and positions of the original numbers. The puzzle, however, raised interesting combinatorial problems for mathematicians, two of whom proved in 2005 that there are 6,670,903,752,021,072,936,960 possible sudoku grids.

### My version
My version of the game closely follows the original with the addition of several customizable features to enhance the player's experience.



At the beginning Players have the option to set game modes in a menu.

There are three grid sizes:
- 6x6
- 9x9 (original)
- 12x12

Three difficulty levels are available for selection:
- easy
- normal
- hard

The chosen difficulty level affects the number of pre-filled cells in the puzzle. 

Once the player has made their selections, the game board loads based on the chosen grid size and difficulty level. The board is then ready for the player to solve.

During the game player can save the game and load it back at any time.
